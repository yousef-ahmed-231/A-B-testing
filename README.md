# A-B-testing
This project will assure you have mastered the subjects covered in the statistics lessons. We have organized the current notebook into the following sections:

Introduction
- Part I - Probability
- Part II - A/B Test
- Part III - Regression
- Final Check

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:

- Implement the new webpage,
- Keep the old webpage, or
- Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
